Hello, I am working on embedding the COVID-19 Symptom Checker (https://www.webmd.com/coronavirus/coronavirus-assessment/default.htm) into a plugin for WordPress dot org. WordPress is the world's largest CMS (Content Management system) for building blogs and interactive websites.
As you may know, WordPress (WP) has strict requirements for themes and plugins in that they must be GPL licensed which just means that all work done for WP is Open source and must be labeled as such.

I am a leading programmer and developer and have no intentions on making returns of any type of profit but am only asking if the embedding of this COVID-19 Symptom Checker is OK to add as a plugin to the wordpress.org plugin repository. https://wordpress.org/plugins/ 

I was not 100% sure about the End User License on this and was not sure whom to reach out to. I picked Media as my choice so I hope you can help me with this question. License URI: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html 

The plugin will be only distributed on wordpress.org and it will also be made available to your company for review, on Github.com, prior to release to the public. Estimated audience to utilize the plugin may be less than one-hundred per month. But all WP plugins are free of cost.

Symptoma Digital Health has something similar but most all are for Statistics or live statistics.
Please forward to the proper department if this is not what your department is capable of answering.
